# Notepad
## Description and tools
This Notepad was made with Electron. The "backend" was made with TypeScript and no third-party packages other than the basic Node and Electron packages. The “front-end” was made with basic HTML, CSS and JS.
It has basic functions such as “save as”, “save”, “open” and “create” a new file. It also has a basic line counter.
The style was created in dark mode and will have more customizable settings in the future, such as themes and other features.
The purpose of creating this project is to improve my knowledge about Electron.

## How to use
1- Clone this project
2- npm install (install the node_modules)
3- npm start (will build and finally start the application)
Note: If want, you can create an application executable using the Electron packager
